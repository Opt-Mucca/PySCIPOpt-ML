In this scenario we take the point of view of a wine manufacturer.

We have access to open source data (thanks to:

Data accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset)
for which we have built a predictor. The predictor takes as input a variety of wine features,
and determines the quality of the wine. This can either be modelled as a regression model,
with the quality being in the range [0,1], or some quality threshold can be set,
and the task made into a classification task.

The goal of this MIP is to create a diverse bouquet of wines with the highest average
quality. To do this, we make an assumption that the features of the grapes and resulting wine
are identical. In this MIP we can purchase grapes from a set of suppliers, all of whom
have grapes that by themselves would result in low quality wine. We can blend the grapes, however,
such that the predicted quality of the wine increases. Each supplier has a limit on the amount of
grapes that can be sold, and an associated cost per unit. Additionally,
we create the same amount of wine for each wine of the bouquet.

Let I be the index set of the wine bouquet that will be created
Let J be the index set of features for each grape / wine.
Let K be the index set of vineyards where the grapes can be purchased
Let x[i][j] be the feature j of wine i
Let y[i] be the quality of the wine i
Let m[i][k] be the amount of grapes from vineyard k used in wine i
let f be the ML predictor that determines the quality of a wine
Let feature_val[j][k] be the value of feature j from vineyard k
Let costs[k] be the cost of one unit of grapes from vineyard k
Let available[k] be the amount of grapes avalable from vineyard k
Let budget be the total budget available

The MIP model is:

x[i][j] = sum_k m[i][k] * feature_val[j][k] for all i, i
sum_k m[i][k] = 1 for all i
sum_i m[i][k] <= available[k]
y[i] = f(x[i][:]) for all i
sum_{i,k} m[i][k] * costs[k] <= budget

max(sum_i y[i])
