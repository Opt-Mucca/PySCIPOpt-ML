"""
In this scenario we take the point of view of a city manager in Poland.

We have access to open source data
(thanks to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krzysztofjamroz/apartment-prices-in-poland),
for which we have built a predictor. The predictor takes as input a variety of apartment features,
and outputs the price of the apartment, which we consider as a proxy for living quality.

The goal of this MIP is to maximise the living quality of the randomly sampled 50 residents by
building two new schools, clinics, post offices, kindergartens, restaurants,
and pharmacies, as well as a single college. For the sake simplicity we assume the
closest access for all these residents to all these facilities is over 10km away.
To further simplify the MIP we measure distance via the L1 norm at all times.

Let f to be the ML predictor. Let I be the index set of residents and their apartments.
Let J be the index of the building type and nJ be the amount of that building type that will be built.
Let k be the index set of the imaginary 2D grid that will be used for L1 distance.

Let a_loc[i][k] be the location of the apartment i in dimension k

Let build[J][nJ][k] be the variables representing the location of the buildings.
Let x[I][J] be the min distance between the buildings and apartments
Let y[i] be the price of the apartment

The MIP we model below in a city of size 5kmx5km is:

For all building types where two are built ensure a minimum distance between each:
    build[J][0][k] - build[J][1][k] == pos_slack[J][k] - neg_slack[J][k] for all J where nJ == 2 for all k
    pos_slack[J][k] <= 10 * bin_slack[J][k] for all J where nJ == 2 for all k
    neg_slack[J][k] <= 10 * (1 - bin_slack[J][k]) for all J where nJ == 2 for all k
    sum_k pos_slack[J][k] + neg_slack[J][k] >= 1 for all J where nJ == 2

For all apartments track the minimum distance between each building

build[j][nJ][k] - a_loc[i][k] == pos_slack[i][j][nJ][k] - neg_slack[i][j][nJ][k] for all I, J, nJ, k
pos_slack[i][j][nJ][k] <= 10 * bin_slack[i][j][nJ][k] for all I, J, nJ, k
neg_slack[i][j][nJ][k] <= 10 * (1 - bin_slack[i][j][nJ][k]) for all I, J, nJ, k
dist_a_b_k[i][j][nJ][k] = pos_slack[i][j][nJ][k] + neg_slack[i][j][nJ][k] for all I, J, nJ, k
dist_a_b[i][j][nJ] = sum_k dist_a_b_k[i][j][nJ][k] for all I, J, nJ

if nJ == 1
x[i][j] = dist_a_b[i][j][0]

if nJ == 2
dist_a_b[i][j][1] - dist_a_b[i][j][0] <= 10 * bin_slack[i][j] for all I, J
dist_a_b[i][j][0] - dist_a_b[i][j][1] <= 10 * (1 - bin_slack[i][j]) for all I, J
x[i][j] <= dist_a_b[i][j][0] for all I, J
x[i][j] <= dist_a_b[i][j][1] for all I, J
x[i][j] >= dist_a_b[i][j][0] - 10 * (1 - bin_slack[i][j]) for all I, J
x[i][j] >= dist_a_b[i][j][1] - 10 bin_slack[i][j] for all I, J

The embedded ML constraints also need to be added
y[i] = f(x[i][:]) for all I
