Library of Examples - SurrogateLIB
######################################

For those interested in more applications, we refer to *SurrogateLIB*. SurrogateLIB is an
accompanying library of instances that are generated using PySCIPOPt-ML. The generators
for the instances also serve as the tests for the repository, and are located in the
``tests`` directory. A complete description of each instance and the instance ``.mps``
files themselves are located `here <https://zenodo.org/records/11231147>`_
