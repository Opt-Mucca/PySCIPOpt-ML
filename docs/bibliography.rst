This code base was heavily inspired by
`Gurobi-MachineLearning <https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-machinelearning/>`_.
The API and general architecture was made to match, so that users could easily
transfer between one to the other. If there is a feature missing here, or you
are looking for alternatives, then give it a try!

Another similar piece of software is
`OMLT <https://github.com/cog-imperial/OMLT>`_ (:cite:t:`ceccon2022omlt`).
As opposed to PySCIPOPT-ML, OMLT is much more general. It uses
general modelling frameworks for both the MIP side and ML side as opposed to
using a specific MIP solver (SCIP) and direct interfaces to ML frameworks.
If interested particularly in non-standard neural network embeddings, please
check it out.
